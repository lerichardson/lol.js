# Get Started
## Using <script>
Include it using the `<script>` html element:  
```
  <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerichardson/lol.js/main/lol.min.js"></script>
```
  You can also use the unminified version, though this is not reccomended.  
```
  <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerichardson/lol.js/main/lol.js"></script>
```
You can also add the second file:
```
  <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerichardson/lol.js/main/cripes.min.js"></script>
```
Again, you can use the unminified version.  
This is the easiest way.  
## Self-host
  Use `gh` if you have it installed, or use `git` otherwise:
```
  gh repo clone lerichardson/lol.js
```
Using `git`:
```
  git clone https://github.com/lerichardson/lol.js.git
```
