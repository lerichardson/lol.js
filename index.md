# lol.js

JavaScript that makes your page look more professional to Snoopy people that like looking at your page source

# Why?

Sometimes, people like to look at your page source and judge you as a developer depending on how much external scripting you have. lol.js is here to fix this.

# What?

lol.js chooses a [pseudo-random](https://random.org) string, and chooses a non-exisitent ```<div>``` to place the string. Don't worry, this won't cause in any more page errors.

# How?

You can: 
1. Include it from GitHub
2. ```git clone https://github.com/lerichardson/lol.js``` or ```gh repo clone lerichardson/lol.js```
3. Have a cow deliver it to you. (NPM coming soon)
Make sure to read the [instructions](https://lerichardson.github.io/lol.js/getting-started).
